## Overview:
This app will help houseplant owners keep track of their plantsâ€™ needs by reminding the user to water the plants and move the plants into and away from sunlight. One common misconception is that houseplants are easy to care for because all they need is water every now and then. The truth is, many plants require much more maintenance such as the perfect amount of sunlight exposure per day - not too much, not too little. GreenHouse aims to make the maintainance of your home greenery much less stressful.
